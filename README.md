# IMTCP
E000, E001, E002, E003, E004, and E005 comprise a suite of streamlined applications that allows computer keyboard button presses to be translated as diatonic pitch and chord events. It was developed by V.J. Manzo (http://vjmanzo.com) as part of a week-long, tech-based music camp cirriculum known as IMTCP (http://imtcp.org) and is now maintained as part of the EAMIR project (http://eamir.org).

The source requires Max 7 or later and the EAMIR SDK package available through Max in the "Package Manager".
